# Product Requirements Document: NYC Events Web Scraping Application

## Introduction/Overview

The NYC Events Web Scraping Application is a comprehensive system designed to aggregate, clean, and present event data from multiple websites across New York City. The application addresses the problem of fragmented event information scattered across various platforms by creating a unified, clean, and accessible database of NYC events. The goal is to provide event attendees with a single source of truth for discovering events happening in New York City.

## Goals

1. **Data Aggregation**: Successfully scrape event data from multiple NYC event websites using Browserbase
2. **Data Quality**: Ensure all events have consistent, complete, and accurate information through automated cleaning and validation
3. **Deduplication**: Eliminate duplicate events across different sources while preserving unique information
4. **User Experience**: Provide an intuitive web interface for browsing and searching NYC events
5. **Scalability**: Handle medium-scale data volume (1,000-10,000 events) with daily updates
6. **Reliability**: Maintain high data accuracy and system uptime

## User Stories

- **As an event attendee**, I want to browse events by date, location, and category so that I can discover events that interest me
- **As an event attendee**, I want to search for specific types of events so that I can find relevant activities quickly
- **As an event attendee**, I want to see complete event details including start time, location, and description so that I can make informed decisions
- **As a data consumer**, I want to access clean, deduplicated event data so that I can trust the information accuracy
- **As a system administrator**, I want automated scraping and cleaning processes so that the data stays current without manual intervention

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Web Scraping System
1.1. The system must integrate with Browserbase for headless browser automation
1.2. The system must support multiple website scrapers (Eventbrite, Meetup, Facebook Events, venue-specific sites, NYC government/cultural sites)
1.3. The system must handle different website structures and data formats
1.4. The system must implement rate limiting and respectful scraping practices
1.5. The system must log scraping activities and handle errors gracefully

### 2. Raw Data Storage
2.1. The system must store scraped data in a raw events table before processing
2.2. The system must preserve original data structure and metadata from each source
2.3. The system must track data source, scraping timestamp, and processing status
2.4. The system must handle data from different sources with varying field structures

### 3. Data Cleaning & Processing
3.1. The system must clean and standardize event data across all sources
3.2. The system must ensure every event has a start time (quality control requirement)
3.3. The system must deduplicate events based on title, date, location, and other identifying factors
3.4. The system must validate data accuracy and flag potential issues
3.5. The system must enrich events with standardized categories and metadata

### 4. Clean Events Database
4.1. The system must maintain a final events table with one entry per unique event
4.2. The system must include standardized fields: title, description, start_time, end_time, location, category, source, price_range
4.3. The system must support efficient querying by date, location, and category
4.4. The system must maintain data lineage back to original sources

### 5. Web User Interface
5.1. The system must provide a web interface for browsing events
5.2. The system must support filtering by date range, location, and category
5.3. The system must provide search functionality for event titles and descriptions
5.4. The system must display event details in a clean, readable format
5.5. The system must be responsive and work on desktop and mobile devices

### 6. Data Management
6.1. The system must support daily automated updates
6.2. The system must handle incremental updates without full data refresh
6.3. The system must maintain data versioning and change tracking
6.4. The system must provide data export capabilities

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Real-time event updates (daily updates are sufficient)
- User accounts and personalization features
- Event booking or ticket purchasing integration
- Social features (sharing, reviews, ratings)
- Mobile native applications (web interface only)
- Advanced analytics or reporting features
- Integration with external calendar systems
- Event recommendation algorithms

## Design Considerations

- **Database Selection**: PostgreSQL recommended for robust data handling, JSON support, and scalability
- **Web Framework**: Simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript initially, with potential for React/Vue upgrade
- **UI/UX**: Clean, minimal design focused on event discovery and information clarity
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach for event browsing on-the-go

## Technical Considerations

- **Browserbase Integration**: Leverage Browserbase's stealth mode and proxy capabilities for reliable scraping
- **Database Architecture**: Separate raw and clean data tables with ETL pipeline
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and retry mechanisms for scraping failures
- **Performance**: Indexed database queries and pagination for large event lists
- **Scalability**: Modular scraper architecture to easily add new data sources

## Success Metrics

- **Data Accuracy**: 95%+ of events have complete start time information
- **Data Completeness**: 90%+ of events have all required fields populated
- **Deduplication Effectiveness**: <5% duplicate events in final database
- **System Reliability**: 99%+ uptime for web interface
- **Data Freshness**: Daily updates completed successfully 95%+ of the time
- **User Experience**: Page load times <2 seconds for event browsing

## Open Questions

1. What specific NYC government/cultural websites should be prioritized for initial scraping?
2. How should the system handle events with multiple sessions or recurring dates?
3. What level of data validation is needed for event pricing information?
4. Should the system support event categories beyond basic classification?
5. What are the specific Browserbase features (stealth mode, proxies) that should be implemented?
6. How should the system handle events with incomplete location information?
7. What backup and disaster recovery requirements exist for the data?
8. Should there be any data retention policies for historical events?
