- [x] 5.0 Scraper Testing & Reporting
  - [x] 5.1 Create scraper test framework (src/test_scrapers.py)
  - [x] 5.2 Implement run comparison logic (current vs previous run)
  - [x] 5.3 Add removed events detection and reporting
  - [x] 5.4 Generate JSON reports and console summaries
  - [x] 5.5 Update all scrapers to call test script after import
  - [x] 5.6 Add start time collection validation (detect midnight times issue)
- [x] 6.0 Data Cleaning Pipeline (Within Source)
  - [x] 6.1 Create data cleaning script (src/clean_events.py)
  - [x] 6.1.1 Fix architecture: READ ONLY from raw_events, WRITE ONLY to clean_events
  - [x] 6.2 Implement latest run detection per source
  - [x] 6.2.1 Add step to clear existing clean events before processing latest run
  - [x] 6.3 Add within-source deduplication logic
  - [x] 6.4 Standardize data formatting (title case, venue normalization)

  - [x] 8.1 Debug Kings Theater - COMPLETED: Created reusable event time extractor using BeautifulSoup + requests. Successfully extracts times from individual event pages without browser context issues.
  - [x] 8.2 Debug MSG event time start issues - COMPLETED: Fixed MSG scraper extraction instruction to properly extract times from calendar page. Updated import script to handle "ET" timezone suffix. MSG events now extract times correctly (96/96 events with times in test).
  - [x] 8.3 Ensure the data cleaning script is running after each scraping session to test for any regressions on things like start time (or lots of events missing between last and current run) - COMPLETED: Verified pipeline runs cleaning and tests automatically after each scraper. Tests detect missing start times, midnight time issues, and large differences in event counts between runs. Updated clean_events.py to include brooklyn_museum in source choices.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- [ ] 9.0 Scraper Refactoring & Testing
  - [x] 9.1 Refactor `msg_calendar.js` - Replace duplicate code with shared function calls, keep unique "Load More Events" logic
  - [x] 9.2 Test `msg_calendar.js` refactor - Run end-to-end and verify events are scraped correctly
  - [x] 9.3 Refactor `prospect_park.js` - Replace duplicate code with shared function calls, use `paginateThroughPages()` helper
  - [x] 9.4 Test `prospect_park.js` refactor - Run end-to-end and verify events are scraped correctly
  - [x] 9.5 Refactor `brooklyn_museum.js` - Replace duplicate code with shared function calls, keep unique "Show more events" logic
  - [x] 9.6 Test `brooklyn_museum.js` refactor - Run end-to-end and verify events are scraped correctly
  - [ ] 9.7 Verify all scrapers still export their main function and support direct execution

Kings Theatre (40 events), MSG Calendar (143 events), and Prospect Park (120 events) all working correctly with proper time extraction. Brooklyn Museum failed with schema validation error - needs debugging.
